From the following tutorial, you will acquire a basic knowledge of the grammar of Daddish and learn to speak it. IntroductionDaddish is the official language of Dad Republic (Daddish: Konharmonёšost Dadad), Earth 0xffffffff. Daddish was invented by a linguist, Vasily Xiao (Daddish: Šjao Vasinёo), and has been promoted nationwide in Dad Republic since its birth. Resources Memorizing Daddish Words Daddish Culture, History, Art, Literature Etc FeaturesWhy should you learn Daddish? Well, for fun, of course! Apart from that, Daddish has some amazing features, including: 9 Grammar Cases; Simple Construction of Words (you can literally construct any word based on its meaning); Restrictive/Non-restrictive Adjectives; Vowel Harmony; Etc… So, let’s get started! Overview Alphabet Verb Construction Person&amp;Number Time&amp;Type Voice Noun Construction Article Case Adjective&amp;Adverb Basic Structure Compound Structure Preposition Not-Attributive-Clause Active Verb-adjective Passive Verb-adjective Not-Nominal-Clause Not-Adverbial-Clause Text Dictionary AlphabetThe alphabet of Daddish is pretty easy, which includes all the letters of the English alphabet except q, w, x and y. And there are also š and č, which respectively represent the sounds sh (as in shove) and ch (as in chance). The letter ё represents the sound [jo], same as that in Russian. Letters (Capital) Letters (Lower) Pronunciation A a /a/ B b /b/ C c /ts/ D d /d/ E e /e/ F f /f/ G g /g/ H h guttural /h/ I i /i/ J j /j/ K k /k/ L l /l/ M m /m/ N n /n/ O o /o/ P p /p/ R r /r/ S s /s/ T t /t/ U u /u/ V v /v/ Z z /z/ Š š /ʃ/ Č č /tʃ/ Ё ё /jo/ VerbConstructionThe verbs in Daddish are very constructed. The original form of a verb always ends with č. If we take that č away, we call the rest the root of the verb. Basically a conjugated verb looks like this: \\rm (Negative\\ Prefix)+(Directional\\ Prefix)+(Aspect\\ Prefix)+Root+Person+Number+Time\\&Type+(Voice)Besides, note that, for the suffixes to attach, it follows the rule of vowel harmony. The vowels in suffixes are always consistent with the last vowel of the root (with a few exceptions). Additionally, when attaching a suffix, you need to pay attention to the end of the word. Let’s say you are attaching the suffix f to the morpheme lek. lek ends with a consonant k, so it should be lekef after conjugation. Similarly, if the ending is a vowel, f becomes fa/fe/fi/fo/fu instead of af/ef/if/of/uf. Person&amp;NumberIn Daddish, the concept of “plural” doesn’t work. Daddish has three types of numbers: Singular, Type II and Type III. Singular, also Type I, is used to represent things in total of 1. Type II is used for 2,3,4 and numbers that end with 2,3,4. Type III is for those that cannot fit in Type I or Type II. Here comes the conjugation table of $\\rm Person$: First Person Second Person Third Person f r (Inclusive) / ss (Exclusive) t And $\\rm Number$: Singular Type II Type III (None) v k Thankfully this works for nouns too! Example: (a) machine (2,3,4…) machines (5…) machines maščin maščiniv maščinik Time&amp;TypeTense consists of aspect and time. There are three times in Daddish: Past, Present, and Future. There are also three types: declarative, imperative, and reportative. Reportative is used when the speaker is reporting what was told. Past Present Future Declarative m š g Imperative šd šd šd Reportative lm tš tg Now that you have learned all the basic verb conjugation, we can make some sentences: Seve leporokotovolm sjadvimaščinih. They(Type II) are said to have got a car. Se (He)+ ve= Seve (They,Type II) le (come)+ po (perfective prefix)+ rok (hand)+ č= leporokč (to get) leporok (root of to get)+ ot (third person)+ ov (Type II)+ olm (past reportative)= leporokotovolm (are said to have got) sjad (self)+ vi (move)+ maščin (machine)+ ih (accusative)= sjadvimaščinih(car, accusative) VoiceFor passive voice, a -sja/sje/sji/sjo/sju is attached to the conjugated verb. The vowel depends on the root. For active voice, this is not needed. NounConstructionThe nouns in Daddish are usually constructed in such way: \\rm Prefix+Root+Suffix\\ with\\ a\\ Meaning+Number+Case+ArticleWe have already discussed the $\\rm Number$ in the previous section. ArticleIn Daddish, there is only definite article. But the definite article can sometimes be omitted, and sometimes can even express the meaning of “that/this/those/these”. The definite article looks like this: \\rm ...-ta/te/ti/to/tuThe vowel, again, should be in line with the root’s. Articles don’t do case conjugation. CaseThere are nine grammar cases in Daddish: Nominative (None) Genitive d Dative z Accusative h Instrumental $\\rm [vowel]+hm$ or $\\rm [consonant]+[vowel]+hm$ Locative p Topicative c Ablative b Vocative s NominativeThe nominative case marks the subject of a verb. When the verb is active, the nominative is the person or thing doing the action; when the verb is passive, the nominative is the person or thing receiving the action. Malcik-ti glazatam boloh-to. The boy saw the ball. Bol-to glazatamsja malcikihm-ti. The ball was seen by the boy. GenitiveThe genitive case has the basic usage of showing possession, along with other derived usage. possession thinkik Dzaneted Janet’s drinks composition kup manakad a group of men reference kapital konharmonёšostod-to capital of the republic DativeThe dative case is used to mark the indirect object. Se darokotom malcikiz giftih. He gave a boy a gift. It can be also used to express the meaning of “to somebody”. Seze ce delo tovnёo. To him, it is a good deed. AccusativeThe accusative case is used to mark a direct object, or after a few prepositions. Tehe amofošo. I love you. Musufug fu-dvaha sekunduvud. I will talk for two seconds. InstrumentalThe instrumental case shows the meaning of “by means of” or “by use of”, or, in passive voice, shows the implementer of an action. Pišifiš penehm. I’m writing with a pen. Bol-to glazatamsja malcikihm-ti. The ball was seen by the boy. LocativeThe locative case shows the location or time. Moskvapa ce komennёe. In Moscow, this is common. TopicativeThe topicative case is a unique case in Daddish. It marks the topic, usually something the speaker is talking about. Šotoc ke knosotoš-c! About death, who knows! It can also be used to change the structure of the sentence for whatever reason. Ekzamac Gokanёac, se častandataš cepe. He is taking part in the National Exam. AblativeThe ablative case expresses the meaning of “out of” or “from”. Ce hobotomsjo manab. This was stolen from a man. VocativeThe vocative case is a grammatical case which is used for a noun that identifies a person (animal, object, etc.) being addressed. Dzjonos, verešd! John, come! Adjective&amp;AdverbBasic StructureIn Daddish, there are two types of adjectives: restrictive and non-restrictive. The original form of a restrictive adjective ends with tornё, while a non-restrictive one just ends with nё. And adjectives also conjugates: \\rm ...nё+[the\\ last\\ vowel\\ in\\ the\\ root\\ of\\ the\\ modified\\ noun]+[corresponding\\ case\\ ending,\\ just\\ like\\ a\\ noun] Djakak kelez titekez tovnёeze! Thanks to all great teachers. (non-restrictive, indicating all teachers are great, and thanking all the teachers) Djakak kelez titekez tovtornёeze! Thanks to all teachers who are great! (restrictive, indicating you are only thanking good teachers, not bad ones) Adverbs are often derived from adjectives, by changing the nё into no. Adverbs never conjugate. Compound StructureNon-restrictive: Prinscipl Vzimvidostod uroktoknёi Einsteinehm ku šokotomnёi fizikmestostod Principle of Relativity, which was put forward by Einstein and shocked the field of physics The adherent adjuncts are connected with ku, which means and. al can be also used, which means or. Restrictive: rubblat-ta s-vahtahm Viniidi kutor ustoktornёa fu-markostoh that red pen with Winnie the Bear on it which is used for marking The adherent adjuncts are connected with kutor instead of ku, and altor instead of al. Preposition Preposition Meaning Case Required fu for Acc. s with Ins. oz against Gen. vkruh around Gen. bifuh before(time) Acc. aft after(time) Acc. ans inside Loc. cent at the center of Gen. em among Gen. fprid in front of Gen. znafp before(space) Gen. čerz through, over Acc. undeh under Ins. dov lasting for(time) Acc. vza while, when Gen. til until Gen. ot because of Gen. lefi in order to, for Gen. sin within Acc. oht without Gen. vasi thanks to Acc. Not-Attributive-ClauseBreaking news: there is no such thing as an “attributive clause” in Daddish! The meaning of the clause is expressed by compound structure, which consists of special adjectives derived from verbs and other stuffs. Active Verb-adjectiveAn active verb-adjective is used to modify a noun that is the implementer of an action. An active verb-adjective is constructed on the basis of a verb. \\rm Active\\ Verb-adjective=[conjugated\\ verb]+(tor)+nёFor example: šokč (to shock)> šokotom (shock, third person, past)> šokotomnё (which shocked) Passive Verb-adjectiveA passive verb-adjective is used to modify a noun that is the patient of an action. A passive verb-adjective is also constructed on the basis of a verb, but has two different structures: \\rm [conjugated\\ verb]+(tor)+nёor \\rm [verb\\ without\\ suffix\\ or\\ č]+tok+nёThe first one gives the exact information of the action, while the second doesn’t emphasize the time or person. And remember, the implementer of the action should be in instrumental case. For example: urokč (to put forward)> uroktoknё (put forward, passive)&gt; uroktoknё Einsteinehm (put forward by Einstein) urokč (to put forward)> urokotomsjonё (an object was put forward)> urokotomsjonё Einsteinehm (an object put forward by Einstein) Not-Nominal-ClauseAnother breaking news: there is no such thing as a “nominal clause” in Daddish! The corresponding meaning is expressed by some structures. ObjectWhen the noun acts as an object in the “clause”, for example: \\rm I\\ know\\ \\underline{what}\\ she\\ has\\ said.Then the structure in Daddish looks like this: \\rm I\\ know,\\ she\\ [magic\\ word]\\ has\\ said.And the magic word is suhu. So the actual sentence looks like this: \\rm Knosofoš,\\ sa\\ suhu\\ pogavatam.Basically, suhu is put before the action in the “clause”, and altogether the structure becomes the object of knosofoš. But this is just basic. Actually, the true magic word is su, and suhu is the accusative case of it. The real rule is: If two parts share the same case, like the example above (both accusative), then put the su right before the action in the “clause” and change it into the correct case. If two parts don’t share the same case, then we need two su. They are put together like su-su, also right before the action in the “clause”. The first one conjugates according the main clause, and the second the subordinate clause. Knosofoš, sa suhu-supu zivitim. I know where she lived. And if there is a preposition: Memefeš, jeve sekundukuh bifuh suhu-oz-sudu photicifivim. I remember against whom we fought seconds ago. Not-Adverbial-ClauseMaterialsLesson 1: Meeting at a CafeA.
